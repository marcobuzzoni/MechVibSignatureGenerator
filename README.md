# MechVibSignatureGenerator
Mechanical vibration signature generator

This Matlab GUI has been designed for researchers and engineer that desire to test new signal processing techniques in the field of diagnosis and condition monitoring of bearings and gears through vibration analysis.
Thanks to its user friendly interface, this tool can simulate the vibration signature produced by complex mechanical system configurations, involving multi-stage gearboxes and related bearings operating at arbitrary conditions (stationary and non-stationary).

Details about the use of this software is provided within the how-to pdf that can be found inside the folder.

Eventually, the authors warmly suggest to read the following reference before using the tool:

M. Buzzoni et al., "A tool for validating and benchmarking signal processing techniques applied to machine diagnosis", Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing, 2020 (accepted, received for production).
